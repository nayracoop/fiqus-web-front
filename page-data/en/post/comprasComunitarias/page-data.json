This is how, as we went along and based on the experience acquired, we built a series of agreements that today are part of our internal regulations.

We traveled to the United Kingdom to meet technology cooperatives from a local network.

We share weekly meetings where we learn about our cultures, discuss our common goals and outline a roadmap to grow the community that composes it. Little by little, we begin to intercooperate with the objective of strengthening our local constructions with a global scale.
