In 2014, one of Fiqus' partners took a carpentry course at a Vocational Training Center (CFP) in the City of Buenos Aires, more specifically at No. 24. The main objective of this type of training centers is to train young people and adults in different trades and activities.

This training center has a particularity, which is that it can be seen as an example of self-management, since it receives a small budget from the government and must carry out a large number of activities to raise funds in order to be self-sustainable and independent.

On one occasion, while doing his course, our partner met the director of the CFP, and he told him about the idea they had: to create a website where the graduates of the courses given at the CFP could offer their services. In this way, the institution would not only train them, but also offer them an almost instantaneous job opportunity. It is worth mentioning that over the years, technical schools have lost weight in secondary education, resulting in a decrease of skilled labor; consequently, it is often difficult to find a reliable professional to perform necessary work, for example, in the home.

We found the idea very interesting, so there was not much hesitation in deciding whether we wanted to be part of it or not. The issue was that considering the costs of the project and the difficulty that the CFP could have in paying for it, we decided to "partner" with them, so that we could carry out the project and give back to the community some of what we received. We consider of great importance to make an investment, above all, with the community around us and thus favor their integration to an increasingly closer reality, such as the presence of technology in everyday life.

An important aspect to mention in this experience is that of **Social Responsibility**.Nowadays, large companies are required to be Corporate Social Responsibility, with the aim of demonstrating how the business world can contribute part of its profit to benefit society; in our world, the world of cooperatives, it is a principle on which we base part of our existence.

So, after a few months of working together with the authorities of CFP N° 24, we were able to launch the [Portal of services](http://serviciosprofesionales.com.ar/), so that it can be used by both graduates and students of the Vocational Training Center, as well as by people from the community who are looking for specialized labor for the realization of technical work.
