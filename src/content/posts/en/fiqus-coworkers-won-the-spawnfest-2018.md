The last days of 2018 did not happen like any other in our cooperative, a member joined the paternity and also participated, along with 2 other partners, in the hackathon [SpawnFest](https://spawnfest.github.io/) and [won](https://spawnfest.org/2018.html) the top prize, in addition to one of the six categories evaluated by the juries.
What a beautiful way to farewell the year! =]

The challenge was based on two days running -November 24th and 25th- programming an idea in some functional language running in the BeamVM (Erlang virtual machine), in our case, the chosen technology is one of our favorites: elixir!

The event was attended by internationally renowned juries, who took some time to choose the winners. That’s why on December 20th we were surprised by this pleasant news and a few days after, the arrival of a new Fiqusito to the world: Welcome Nehuén!

SpawnFestThe project in question was called [Lambdex](https://github.com/fiqus/lambdex), being able to achieve a prototype with minimal but full functionality, with examples and documentation.
Lambdex is a _serverless_ code execution service, allowing to run code without building the whole surrounding server infrastructure.
Similar to [AWS Lambda](https://aws.amazon.com/en/lambda/features/) but obviously open-source.

From this, in our [github](https://github.com/fiqus) we forked the repository and we will be adding functionalities, making this project grow.
The repo has a README where it explains what it is about and how to run it.

With time we will organize it better and of course we accept pull requests for those who want to collaborate:

Go on 2019!
